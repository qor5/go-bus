# PubSub System Enhancements TODO

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the PubSub system.

## 1. Enhanced SubscribeOptions

### 1.1 Auto-Drain on Unsubscribe

- Add `WithAutoDrain()` option to SubscribeOptions
- Implement functionality to automatically execute `Drain()` when `Unsubscribe()` is called
- Ensure proper error handling during the auto-drain process
- Add configuration to control drain behavior (e.g., timeout, force drain)
- Add documentation for the auto-drain feature and usage scenarios
- Add tests for various auto-drain scenarios including error conditions

### 1.2 Automatic Heartbeat Interval

- Add `WithAutoHeartbeatInterval(duration)` option to SubscribeOptions
- Implement automatic heartbeat mechanism that runs in the background
- Add configuration for heartbeat interval and failure handling
- Ensure heartbeat stops when subscription is unsubscribed
- Add metrics for heartbeat success/failure rates
- Add documentation for heartbeat configuration and monitoring
- Add tests for heartbeat functionality including edge cases

## Implementation Priority

1. Automatic Heartbeat Interval (improves reliability and operational simplicity)
2. Auto-Drain on Unsubscribe (improves operational safety)

## Notes

- All implementations should maintain backward compatibility
- Performance benchmarks should be conducted before and after each implementation
- Code review required for each enhancement before merging
- Consider the interaction between auto-heartbeat and auto-drain features
