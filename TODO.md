# PubSub System Enhancements TODO

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the PubSub system.

## 1. Subscription Caching

- Implement caching mechanism for Subscriptions to improve performance
- Create a dedicated Subject for Subscription synchronization
- Establish a convention for cache invalidation and updates
- Design a protocol to reduce cache inconsistency across nodes
- Add metrics for cache hit/miss rates
- Document the caching strategy and synchronization protocol

## 2. Queue Drain Functionality

- Add a `Drain` method to the Queue interface
- Implement functionality to clean up all related Subscriptions and Jobs in a single operation
- Add graceful shutdown capabilities
- Ensure proper error handling during the drain process
- Add documentation for the Drain method usage
- Add tests for various drain scenarios

## Implementation Priority

1. Subscription Caching (highest impact on performance)
2. Queue Drain Functionality (improves operational capabilities)

## Notes

- All implementations should maintain backward compatibility
- Performance benchmarks should be conducted before and after each implementation
- Code review required for each enhancement before merging
